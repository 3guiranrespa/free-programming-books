## What to Expect from Tomb Raider 2013 Gameplay
 
Tomb Raider 2013 is not just a reboot of the iconic franchise, but also a reinvention of the gameplay mechanics that made Lara Croft famous. In this game, you will experience Lara's origin story as she struggles to survive on a hostile island full of dangers and mysteries. You will also witness her evolution from a frightened young woman to a hardened survivor.
 
The gameplay of Tomb Raider 2013 is divided into three main aspects: exploration, combat, and survival. Exploration involves traversing the island's diverse environments, such as forests, caves, tombs, and shanty towns, using Lara's skills and tools. You will be able to climb, jump, slide, swing, and zipline across the terrain, as well as use a torch, a rope arrow, and a climbing axe to access new areas. You will also find collectibles, relics, documents, and GPS caches that reveal more about the island's history and secrets.
 
Combat involves fighting against the island's inhabitants, who are part of a cult called the Solarii Brotherhood. They are armed with various weapons, such as bows, guns, machetes, and explosives. You will have to use stealth, cover, and tactics to take them down, as well as use the environment to your advantage. You will also have access to a variety of weapons yourself, such as a bow, a pistol, a shotgun, a rifle, and a grenade launcher. You can upgrade your weapons and skills by collecting salvage and experience points throughout the game.
 
Survival involves managing Lara's health and resources in order to stay alive. You will have to scavenge for food, water, ammo, and medical supplies, as well as craft items such as arrows and bandages. You will also have to deal with environmental hazards such as fire, water, traps, and wildlife. You can use Lara's survival instinct mode to highlight items of interest and objectives in your surroundings. You can also use base camps to fast travel between locations, save your progress, and upgrade your gear.
 
Tomb Raider 2013 also features a multiplayer mode that allows you to play as either Lara's shipmates or the Solarii in various modes such as Team Deathmatch, Rescue, Cry for Help, and Free for All. You can customize your character's appearance and loadout with different weapons and perks. You can also unlock new maps and modes by playing the single-player campaign.
 
Tomb Raider 2013 is a thrilling and immersive game that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It is a must-play for fans of action-adventure games and Lara Croft herself.
